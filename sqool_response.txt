Look at the departments table in the school database provided to you. How many columns does it have and what are the column names?
- two columns (id, name)

Which column in the departments table is intended to be uniquely identifying?
- id

Look at the teachers schema. Which column is being used as a foreign key? Why might we be using a foreign key here rather than storing the data directly in this table? Review the last paragraph if you are unclear.
- department

Look at the remaining table schemas in this database. Whiteboard each of the 5 tables, representing them as simple spreadsheet like grids, using arrows to indicate where a particular column is referring to data stored in another table.
>select * from students;

Display the name column for every row in the students table
id          name
----------  ----------
1           lauren
2           dan
3           naomi
4           kim
5           sam
6           chris

Display every column for the teachers table. The department column just contains numbers, what are these numbers referencing? (Look at the teachers schema if you need to).
id          name        department
----------  ----------  ----------
1           fred        1
2           pamela      2
3           beth        1
4           sunny       2
department refers to department table

Display every column for the teachers table and then every column for the departments table. Just by looking at the tables, what is the name of the department that the teacher beth is a part of?
> select * from teachers;
-1

Display just the name column for all the students whose names are not naomi. (Note, naomi being text, should be placed in single quotes)
> SELECT name from students WHERE name != 'naomi';

name
----------
lauren
dan
kim
sam
chris

Display the name and department id of teachers whose own id is greater than 2 or whose name is 'fred'
> SELECT name, department from teachers WHERE id > 2 OR name = 'fred';
name        department
----------  ----------
fred        1
beth        1
sunny       2


Display the id and name of all the students whose names end in 'm'
>SELECT id,name from students where name LIKE %m;

Display all columns for students whose names do not contain the letter 'a'. HINT: a more long-winded way to say "includes the letter 'a'" is "includes 0 or more of any letter followed by an 'a' followed by 0 or more of any letter."
